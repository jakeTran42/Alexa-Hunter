# Branching

1. Clone Repo
2. git checkout -b "develop"
3. git add, commit --> git push -u origin develop (this will push upstream to the main develop branch for all contributers)
4. Make a new branch if you want to make a quick fix to develop/master branch and then merge it into develop/master. Remember to fix your conflicts.
